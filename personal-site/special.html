These two perks go perfect together, Envious Assassin when getting kills with your primary it transfers one round from reserves to your magazine, possibly loading all your reserves. Combine it with Controlled Burst you got yourself a damage machine. Controlled Burst provides a damage and charge time buff, when landing all your shots on target. when you have 20 rounds and the damage buff stacks you have yourself one of the highest damage fusion rifles.</p>

                        <p>The Forbearance is a Wave Frame Grenade Launcher and is obtained from the Vow of the Deciple Raid on The Throne World. This is a beloved weapon by everyone in an ad-clear senario. It is able to take out hoards of minor enemies in one shot and continue ot do for a wile. The main perks to use on this weapon are Ambistous Assassin and Chain Reaction. Ambitious Assassin works a little differently than Envious Assassin but they are very similar in liking but the difference between the two is that Ambitious Assassin reloads to a 150% of the magazine rounding up which will only give you 2 shots in this grenade launcher. But what makes this better is Chain Reaction, this perk on a final blow of an enemy creates an elemental explosion damaging everything aroundit causing everything in its path to erupt.</p>
