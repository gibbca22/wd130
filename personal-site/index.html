                        <p>Rufus Fury has a very unique look to it but with that look it is a amazing weapon to the core with its ablilty to deal damage as a primary weapon and clear a room with one magaizine. This weapon is achieved though the Root of Nightmares Raid on Neptune. The most common roll for this weapon that most people strive fore is Reconstruction and Target lock. Reconstruction is an amazing perk in of it self with its ability to reload 10 percent of the magazine every 4 seconds up to double the magazine size. Target Lock is really good on this weapon when paired with Reconstruction because the longer you remain on target the more damage this weapon will put out even as a primary. weapon</p>

                        <p>The Fatebringer (Time Lost) is the perfect hand cannon that can be used almost anywhere. This weapon is from the Vault of Glass Raid on master difficulty. So buckle up with a few buddies and head to the Vault of glass. This weapon looks and sounds amazing and functions just as you expect, the best roll for this weapon is Explosive Payload and Firefly. Explosive Payload does just as it sounds when you hit an enemy with a bullet it explodes dealing extra damage with no drop off which goes perfectly with Firefly. Firefly is a very handy perk on many weapons, Firefly is a perk where when you land a precision final blow it becomes explosive dealing damage to enemy combatants around it and potentialy causing them to explode too clearing rooms.</p>
